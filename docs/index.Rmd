## Covid Report
Accross tthe two years of the covid-19 pandemic in the US, there have been `r get_total_cases()` total cases in the US. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
